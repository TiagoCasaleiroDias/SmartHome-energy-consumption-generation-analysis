## Project Description

The objective of this project is to use exploratory analysis and inference statistics to make a complete and thorough analysis in the patterns
of energy generation and energy consumption of a SmartHome. The energy is generated through solar panels on the rooftop of the house. The
consumption includes the energy spent on every applicance in the house.

## Hypotheses / Questions

- Does this location has potential to deploy a P2P solar energy sharing business? 

## Dataset

I used a dataset from Kaggle, that contains the readings of a solar panel energy generation and the energy consumption per appliance of a SmartHome. The readings were taken minute by minute, in the year of 2016.

## Workflow

1. Prepared the dataset with the features that I was interested in and then aggregated the dataset in KWH.
2. Calculated general consumption, adding the consumption of each appliance
3. Exploratory analysis - Data visualization on Tableau
4. Inference Statistics - Hypothesis testing on the months with higher generation, from 3:00PM to 7:00PM.
